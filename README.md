# P2P-file-transfer
This project is for a networking practice that implements the Server/Client Model.
It begins with code for a connection meant for only one client and server to implementing multithreading techniques to allow multuple clients to connect to th server

The last section is an implementation of a P2P network where the server has a stored file and sends partial pieces to each peer and the peers then communicate with the other peers to get the rest.
The codes is yet to be perfected and there may be some aspects that can be optimized and perfected.
